            Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born as
            a nonsense text. “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, and it
            actually says nothing,” Before & After magazine answered a curious
            reader, “Its ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency with which
            letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it looks pretty
            real.”

            The placeholder text, beginning with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor sit
            amet, consectetur adipiscing elit”, looks like Latin because in its
            youth, centuries ago, it was Latin.

            Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is
            credited with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler
            text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by
            consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin
            dictionary led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et
            Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C.
            text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.
