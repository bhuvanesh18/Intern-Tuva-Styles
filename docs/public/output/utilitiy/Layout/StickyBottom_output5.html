            Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born as
            a nonsense text. “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, and it
            actually says nothing,” Before & After magazine answered a curious
            reader, “Its ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency with which
            letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it looks pretty
            real.”

            Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is
            credited with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler
            text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by
            consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin
            dictionary led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et
            Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C.
            text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.
